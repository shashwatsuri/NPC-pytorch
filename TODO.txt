1)camP uses residuals so let camcal be more or less how it is and update stuff during process_zhu or something
2)remember you need dpi/dphi not dl/dphi so you dont need the backprop stuff i dont think
3)identitycam might need a comeback
4)the way you have generated the noise is wrong, we need absolute noise and then a way to use those exact parameters with camP. maybe use load_path with those residuals and then have a camP flag
